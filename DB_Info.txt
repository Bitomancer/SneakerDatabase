Stores Collection: Stores.json

A “Store” is a representation of a sneaker store, either one that is online, in person, or both. 
AQL allows for variability in-store data that a relational database would be too rigid to represent.

Some basic Queries to test:

For every store, return the name, owner, and whether or not they have uniform prices
for S in Stores
    		return {StoreName:S.name, Owner: S.owner, UniformPrices: S.uniform_prices}

Group stores by type (in person, online, or hybrid) and return each type and the amount of each type.
for S in Stores
    		collect Type = S.type into T
        		return {Type: Type, AmountOfType: length(T)}

Just a nested query to retrieve all the sneakers in the dataset
for S in Stores
   		for N in S.sneakers_in_store[*]
       	 		return {Model: N.model, StockInformation: (
      	 			for sn in N.size_and_stock_info[*] 
       	 			return sn)}

Sample data: 

{
  "type": "hybrid", /* whether the store is online, an in-person shop, or both */
  "street": "812 Broadway",
  "zip": "10003",
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "name": "Flight Club",
  "owner": "Damany Weir",
  "twitter": "flightclub", /* optional social media fields, advantage of aql
  "facebook": "@FlightClub",
  "uniform_prices": "N", /* whether or not a store sells shoes at different prices based on size */
  "sneakers_in_store": [
    {
      "model": "KD 4 Aunt Pearl",
      "colors": [ /* array of colors that are on the shoe */
        "pink",
        "black"
      ],
      "brand": "Nike", /* price would be an attribute if there are uniform prices */
      "sneakerID": 100000,
      "size_and_stock_info": [ /* holds info on size, number of that size in stock, and price if there are not uniform prices */
        {
          "size": 8,
          "num_in_stock": 1,
          "price": 500
        }    ]

Sneakerheads collection: Sneakerheads.json

A “sneakerhead” is really just another name for a customer of the shoe stores.

  "city": "Lake Charles",
  "state": "LA",

  "sneakers_interested_in": [
    {
      "model": "Air Jordan 1",
      "brand": "Jordan",
      "colors": [
        "Any" /*colors of the model that they like, can be specific colors, or ‘any’ */
      ]
    }
]
